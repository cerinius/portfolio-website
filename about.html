                        <h3>Biography</h3>
                        <p>I'm a software developer. It has become a passion of mine that I find more and more exciting with every new application I deliver. The challenge of working on a team to create solutions never gets old. After working on a wide variety of projects, I am still enthusiastic about finding better approaches to provide solutions as a developer.</p>
                        <p>I have completed the Computer Programmer program at Niagara College, taking 2 years and earning a diploma. During my time at Niagara College, I also participated in developing a software solution for a community sponsor, helping fellow students in my classes, and contributing to open-source projects in various video game related communities.</p>
                        <p>From the moment I produced “Hello World” in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been “just a job” for me, it’s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by. </p>
                        <p>Outside of software development, I spend most of my time cooking mouth watering food and watching sci-fi movies.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                        <p>Software development is about solving problems. It’s meant to take a problem that someone is facing and make dealing with it easier using an application, without removing the user’s say while solving the problem.</p>
                        <p>Programs should be accessible. I strive to create code solutions that any person would be able to pick up and understand without becoming frustrated or displeased with the experience of using it. No one should be left out of the capabilities of software no matter disabilities, lack of experience or even simply knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Developing should be done in a way to foster a supportive community. Coding practices that solve problems in new ways should be shared with the world. The open source community, and contributing to it, allows everyone involved to grow off each other, while also still leaving opportunities for people to make new strides. Closing the doors on your work sets everyone back, because your idea could be the catalyst for someone else’s idea.</p>
                        <p>As a programmer,I look to make a significant difference in the life of everyone my software is involved in. Whether it’s the developers I work with, the clients I present completed work to, or their end users that will be using the software. I aim to help people I’m involved with solve their everyday problems with software, use elegant solutions for problems they face every day, and support their future by maintaining code and improving it’s functionality.</p>
